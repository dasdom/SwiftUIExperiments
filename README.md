The alignment of the `0` button to the leading edge of `1` and the trailing edge of `2` is not easy. All my attempts resulted in broken layout. For the moment I decided to add a second `0` button. I guess with version 1.0 or 2.0 of SwiftUI there will be easy solutions to align the buttons to each other.

See the alignment bug from the calculator above. In addition there is a space bug resulting in a white space between the label and the buttons. I expect that to be solved before SwiftUI 1.0 ships.

The resizing of images is totally broken. I have no idea how Apple manages to get it to work in their session demos. It doesn't work at all in the first beta.

Same alignment bug as for the calculator. Therefore the subject an the text are not aligned to the sender.
